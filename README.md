# FLet

*A collection of micro frameworks*

## Frameworks

- [t (FLet.testing)](https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/t): ðŸ§ª Quickly test expectations
    - `t` is a simple testing framework using closures and errors. You have the ability to create a `suite` that has multiple steps, expectations, and asserts. Expectations can be used to `expect` one or multiple assertions. `t` can be used to test quickly inside a function to make sure something is working as expected. `t` can also be used in unit test if wanted.

- [c (FLet.composition)](https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/c): ðŸ“¦ Micro Composition using Transformations and Cache
    - `c` is a simple composition framework. You have the ability to create transformations that are either unidirectional or bidirectional. There is also a cache that values can be set and resolved. `c` can be used anywhere to create transformations or interact with the cache.
    
- [o (FLet.transput)](https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/o): Output and Input for File, URL, and Console
    - `o` is a simple framework to output to a file, url, the console, or even register notification using UserNotifications. `o` can also get input from a file, url, or console. Currently, `o` can be used on macOS, iOS, and watchOS.
